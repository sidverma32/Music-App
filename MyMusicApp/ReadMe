MyMusic Player: This is the main module; users can play their favorite uploaded music from this page.
First, by default, we will display the albums with album name and image. User can click on any of their
favorite albums to play the music. When user clicks on the album image, we will play the first song of
that album, by default. Users can add any number of songs to their albums to play.

After the user selects the album, we will check for the songs to be added in the album. 
If there are no songs for the selected album, then we display the message as "No Songs has been added in this Album”.
If album has songs, then we display our MyMusic Player.
From this page, the user can change and play any songs from the list as per his/her choice.
In the player, we will display the album image and the title along with the current playing song file name.
In the list, we will also display singer name, music file name, 
and description of the file. User can play, pause, and play next and previous songs of the list.

Albums are nothing but it’s a favorite or play list.
First, user can create albums and add all his/her favorite songs in that album. 
In the database, we have created two tables. 
One is Album table (as master) and another is music table (as details).

This is our main part as we will be adding all our music files to be played in this detail table.
Here, we select our album from combobox and add music details and upload to our root directory to play our songs.
Users can add new songs, edit, and delete the songs.
