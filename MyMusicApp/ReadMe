After the user selects the album, we will check for the songs to be added in the album. 
If there are no songs for the selected album, then we display the message as "No Songs has been added in this Album”.
If album has songs, then we display our MyMusic Player.
From this page, the user can change and play any songs from the list as per his/her choice.
In the player, we will display the album image and the title along with the current playing song file name.
In the list, we will also display singer name, music file name, 
and description of the file. User can play, pause, and play next and previous songs of the list.
